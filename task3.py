# Your task is to write a Python program to find whether a given number (prompted from the user) is even or odd.  Print out an appropriate message to the user.

# - Some of your results could look like this:


number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print(number, "is even.")
else:
    print(number, "is odd.")
